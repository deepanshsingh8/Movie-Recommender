# Movie Recommender System

This project provides a recommender system using Collaborative Filtering via Cosine Similarity

## Getting Started
The goals of this project are:
* Test various Machine Learning approaches for suitability for use as a recommender
* Implement user derived Collaboritive Filtering to predict users’ ratings on movies using all users.
* Implement item derived Collaboritive Filtering to predict users’ ratings on movies using all items.
* Predict the k most similar movies and users according to each movie and user.
* Improve the user derived approach using only top-K most similar user ratings.
* Prove that Collaboritive Filtering is a simple but effectice means of for recommending in a memory-based context.
* Show that using top-K users vs overall is more accurate.
